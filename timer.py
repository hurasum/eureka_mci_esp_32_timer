This class includes support for using ESP32 hardware timer peripheral

    The ESP32 chip contains two hardware timer groups. Each group has two general-purpose hardware timers. They are all 64-bit generic timers based on 16-bit prescalers and 64-bit auto-reload-capable up / down counters.

Features

    Several timer operational modes are available:

Mode 	Description
ONE_SHOT 	When timer is started, it runs for defined time and stops.
If given, the callback function is executed when the defined time elapses.
PERIODIC 	Timer runs repeatedly until explicitly stopped.
When defined time elapses the callback function is executed, if given
CHRONO 	Used for measuring the elapsed time with µs precision.
Can be started, paused, resumed and stopped
EXTBASE 	Base timer for extended timers. Only timer 0 can be used in this mode.

    Up to 4 hardware timers can be used.
    Up to 8 extended timers can be used if timer 0 is configured in EXTBASE mode.
    That way total of 11 timers can be used.
    Extended timers can operate only in ONE_SHOT or PERIODIC modes.
    In CHRONO mode timers uses 1 MHz clock as timer base frequency to achieve 1 µs resolution.
    In other modes timers uses 2 kHz clock as timer base frequency, resulution of 1 ms is available.
    Each timer keeps track of number of timer events and number of executed callbacks

Warnng:

    Due to MicroPython callback latency, some callbacks may not be executed if the timer period is less than 15 ms.
    The number of events and executed callbacks can be checked using tm.events() method.
